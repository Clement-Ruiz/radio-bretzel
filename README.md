This project is a private and collaborative web radio project, using LiquidSoap and Icecast2.

Requirements : 
	- We highly recommand a Debian-based distro
	- Liquidsoap (get it here : http://savonet.sourceforge.net/download.html)
	- Icecast2 (get it here : http://http://icecast.org/download/)

Then, copy the "config/" folder in your /etc renaming it as "icecast2". restart Icecast service and run script/test.liq to see if it's working !
